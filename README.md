## Description

My motivation was to build the back end for an e-commerce site that creates and holds a database for retailers to utilize as a site for internet retailing / e-commerce. 

This creates a site that utilizes back-end features by configuring Express.js API to use Sequelize and interact with a MySQL database. ANd from this project, I learned how to utilize Sequelize and MySQL.

## Installation

Starting the Server:
1. Open a terminal with `server.js`
2. In the terminal, enter `npm install`
3. Update your `.env`
4. In the terminal, enter `mysql -u root -p` and complete
5. Enter `SOURCE db\schema.sql` and `exit`
6. Enter `npm run seed`
7. Enter `npm run start`
8. Open http://localhost:3001/ in Insomnia or related app
